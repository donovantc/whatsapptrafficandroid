Android WhatsupTraffic App

Started 03-06-2013

This is an Android App that shows tweets relating to traffic in South Africa. This is one of my personal projects which I just started very recently (June 2013). I plan on growing it whenever I get a chance.

At the moment, it just loads the tweets and shows them on a list. This project uses the MVP design pattern for Android Applications and uses external libraries (twitter4j) to handle Twitter related functionality.
